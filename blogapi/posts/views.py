# Django REST Framework has several generic views that are helpful. We have already used 
# ListAPIView in both the Library and Todos APIs to create a read-only endpoint collection, 
# essentially a list of all model instances. In the Todos API we also used RetrieveAPIView for a
# read-only single endpoint, which is analogous to a detail view in traditional Django.

# For our Blog API we want to list all available blog posts as a read-write endpoint which means
# using ListCreateAPIView, which is similar to the ListAPIView weâ€™ve used previously but allows
# for writes. We also want to make the individual blog posts available to be read, updated, or
# deleted. There is a built-in generic Django REST Framework view just for this purpose:
# RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView.

# PostList uses the generic ListCreateAPIView
class PostList(generics.ListCreateAPIView):
    # To restrict access to our data at the view level (one way to do it), we import permissions in our view at the top, then define it within our views as per below.
    # The issue with doing the views based permissions is that as a project grows we need to constantly add new lines of code to add restrictions. This can be avoided it we do it at a project level. See settings for global auth changes.
    # permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticated,)
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer
    
    
# PostDetail uses the RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView
class PostDetail(generics.RetrieveUpdateDestroyAPIView):
    # permission_classes = (permissions.IsAuthenticated,)
    
    # In views.py we import IsAuthorOrReadOnly and then add the permission classes to PostDetail (extension of permissions.py to allow adming all access vs common user or no user)
    # We import IsAuthorOrReadOnly from our permissions.py module.
    permission_classes = (IsAuthorOrReadOnly,)
    
    queryset = Post.objects.all()
    serializer_class = PostSerializer
